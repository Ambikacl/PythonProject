# Corona Symptoms checking using Find-S algarithm

## Introduction
The Find-S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm in machine learning. The find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive examples. We have to note here that the algorithm considers only those positive training example. Nowadays, the main problem we are facing is that Corona Virus. Because of this we have lost manpower and one of the major problems is that we are facing now is that fear of having Corona. Because of this people start worrying even for head ache and common cold. This project helps the patients to know whether they have the severe symptoms of corona or not, by taking the inputs of symptoms from the patients. By comparing these symptoms with the available data sets,this projects tells the patients that whether they have severe symptoms of corona or not. In the given data set, not having symptoms are the positive training example.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to check whether patients have the severe symptoms of Corona or not.
In this, we will take the all the symptoms information from patients and we'll tell the patients that they are having severe symptoms or not.

## Requirements
We need to know the following python modules to build this project.

<ins>**Find S algarithm**</ins> :The Find-S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm in machine learning. The find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive examples.

<ins>**Pandas and NumPy module**</ins> : These two modules can be installed in pycharm by using command **"pip install pandas"** in pycharm terminal.
