# Corona Symptoms checking using Find S algarithm

##Introduction
The find-S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm in machine learning. The find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive examples. We have to note here that the algorithm considers only those positive training example. Here in the given example, not having symptoms are positive training example. This project tells the patient whether he has the severe or important symptoms or not with the help of available data sets.

##Objective
The objective of this project is to check whether a patient have the severe symptoms of Corona or not.
In this, we will take the all the symptoms information from patients and we'll tell the patients that they are having severe symptoms or not.

##Requirements
We need to know the following python modules to build this project.

Find S algarithm :The find-S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm in machine learning. The find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive examples.

Pandas and NumPy module : These two modules can be installed in pycharm by using command "pip install pandas" in pycharm terminal
Pandas is an open source library in Python. It provides ready to use high-performance data structures and data analysis tools.Pandas module runs on top of NumPy and it is popularly used for data science and data analytics. NumPy is a low-level data structure that supports multi-dimensional arrays and a wide range of mathematical array operations. Pandas has a higher-level interface. It also provides streamlined alignment of tabular data and powerful time series functionality.
